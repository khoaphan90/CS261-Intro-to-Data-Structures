1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive 
push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the 
array will double in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic
array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, 
what is the big-oh complexity for a push?

1-8 = 8 units of cost
9 = 9 units of cost
10-16 = 7 units of cost
17 = 17 units of cost
18-32 = 15 units of cost
Total cost: 56 units of cost

The big-oh complexity for a push is O(1)+.

2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive 
push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the 
array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already 
full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy
for resizing, what is the big-oh complexity for a push?

1-8 = 8 units of cost
9-10= 10 unit of cost
11-12 = 12 units of costs
13-14 = 14 units of costs
15-16 = 16 units of costs
17-18 = 18 units of costs
19-20 = 20 units of costs
21-22 = 22 units of costs
23-24 = 24 units of costs
25-26 = 26 units of costs
27-28 = 28 units of costs
29-30 = 30 units of costs
31-32 = 32 units of costs
Total cost: 260

The big-oh complexity for a push is O(N2).
